## Description and Screenshots

### Options Section

All user options are saved using [storage.sync](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync) which allows you to login to [Chrome](https://accounts.google.com) or [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/)  and sync your settings across different devices. Your settings also remain available locally after a browser restart even if you do not login with a Chrome or Mozilla account.

#### Preferences

The screenshot below shows the "Preferences" section. It allows you to control the following four functions:
* Allow or prevent saving invalid URLs in the Options section
* Allow or prevent using invalid URLs in the Client section
* Allow or prevent saving message bodies with invalid JSON in the Options section
* Allow or prevent using message bodies with invalid JSON Client section

#### Server URLs

The screenshot below shows the "Server URLs" section. It allows you to save URLs that you can use later in the Client section by selecting them from a dropdown menu. You can create, edit, and delete URLs. When creating or editing a URL you will receive a warning if the URL does not begin with `ws://` or `wss://` or if the URL contains spaces.

#### Messages

The screenshot below shows the "Messages" section. It allows you to save message names and bodies that you can use later in the Client section by selecting the message name from a dropdown menu. You can create, edit, and delete messages. You will receive a warning if the message body is not valid JSON. Note the toggle switch under the message body textarea. Use it to change the JSON formatting from single line to multi-line and vice versa.

## Manual Installation

Installing manually should only be necessary if you want to make changes to the extension and possibly submit a pull request. The instructions below assume you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

```
cd /some/directory
git clone https://github.com/kensiprell/browser-websocket-client.git
cd browser-websocket-client
npm install
```

After ```npm``` finishes you can edit files as necessary, focusing on the files in the ```src/main/**``` and ```src/test/cypress/integration``` directories although you probably don't need to make changes to ```background.js```.

The ```scripts``` section of ```package.json``` should be self explanatory. For example, if you want to test changes on Chrome, you would do the following from the project root directory (```/some/directory/browser-websocket-client```):

```
npm run build:chrome
```

Then you can load the unpacked extension using these [instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) and choosing the path below:

```
/some/directory/browser-websocket-client/build/dev/chrome
```

~~And for Firefox you could do the following from the project root directory:~~

```
npm run build:firefox
```

Then you can load the unpacked extension using these [instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) and choosing the path below:

```
/some/directory/browser-websocket-client/build/dev/firefox
```

## Development Notes

The JavaScript is written in ES6.
 
[jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) provide the heavy lifting.

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) does all the testing.

## Inspiration

This extension was inspired by [Simple-WebSocket-Client](https://github.com/hakobera/Simple-WebSocket-Client).

The `highlightJson` function came from this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7220510/1705701).
